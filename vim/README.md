### Check Information

    In Vim, your home directory is specified with $HOME. On Unix systems, this is your ~ directory. On Windows systems, the best way to find the value of $HOME is from within Vim, as follows. These commands are useful to see what directories your Vim is using:

    :version
    :echo expand('~')
    :echo $HOME
    :echo $VIM
    :echo $VIMRUNTIME
